0,Adult female with positive HIV infection and low CD4 count. Shortness of breath and cough. The visualized lung fields show hazy opacification with peribronchial and some interstitial prominence in the form of fine reticular interstitial pulmonary pattern. The case showed progressive deterioration as shown from the demonstrated XR sequences. The last one shows more diffuse infiltrates with ET tube insertion in ventilated victim. Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities or septal thickening are present. A crazy paving pattern may therefore be seen when both ground-glass opacies and septal thickening are superimposed on one another.

0,"History of HIV, loss of viral suppression, a few weeks of shortness of breath, cough, malaise and weight loss. Although there is no focus of airspace opacification, there is hazy ground glass involving both lungs and a reticular pattern of opacification.  The lungs are of normal volume, there is no collapse and no pleural effusion. Further features in the history were gradual weight loss.  A whole body CT was performed to look for sources of infection and lymphadenopathy. A mid and lower zone diffuse ground glass pattern was seen, with admixed areas of interlobular septal thickening, giving a ""crazy paving"" pattern. Some small cystic spaces were observed too.  No nodules, nodes or pleural effusions were seen. The heart was not enlarged."

0,"there is marked improvement seen in the right lung; however, there is no sign of regression in the left lower zone. There is also a nasogastric tube which appears to be appropriately positioned."
0,"Multifocal patchy opacities with diffuse reticular markings. These findings are nonspecific, but in the setting of a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3, should raise suspicion for PCP."
