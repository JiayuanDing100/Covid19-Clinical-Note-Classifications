Hospitalization and, in the light of the radiological finding, request for Covid 19 infectious disease assessment and research, which is positive. In the next hour worsening of dyspnea and need for hospitalization in Resuscitation."
0,"If left untreated, chest X-ray may progress to alveolar consolidation in 3 or 4 days. Infiltrates clear within 2 weeks, but in a proportion infection will be followed by coarse reticular opacification and fibrosis. Note the large cyst (arrow)"

1,"Chest CT in convalescent stage showed persistent multifocal GGOs with or without superimposed reticulation and mild fibrotic change at bilateral lungs, including peripheral subpleural regions of both lower lobes. Two small irregular opacities at the RUL and RML were probably partially resolved consolidations (arrows)."

1,"Chest radiogram at onset, performed on an outpatient basis in another hospital: o pleuroparenchymal thickenings; thickening of the peribronco-vascular interstitium. """
1,40-year-old female patient with Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. Initial posteroanterior chest radiograph and chest CT scan were performed on day of admission (3 days after onset of fever). Chest radiograph(A)shows no thoracic abnormalities. Axial CT scan(B)shows GGOs in subpleural area of right lower lobe. Left lung is normal. Patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs were almost absorbed leaving a few fibrous lesions that may represent residual organizing pneumonia. Repeat real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was negative and patient was discharged.

1,"Woman, 55 years old, reports dyspnea for a few days, does not report fever. In the history of asthma and type II diabetes. At first he denies contacts with people in a feverish state and coming from areas at risk. After a more accurate and ""insistent"" anamnesis, he reports that the cohabiting son works in a company where COVID-19 cases have occurred in the risk area (Lombardy)."
1,Bronchial wall thickening. Small peripheral patchy infiltrates.
1,"Chest X-ray showed progression of prominent bilateral perihilar infiltration and ill-defined patchy opacities at bilateral lungs, which slowly resolved on the follow-up image."
0,"When patient presented to ED there was wide spread opacity across patient right lung field especially on lower lung field with positive air-bronchogram which indicate consolidation of right lower or middle lobe. There was some opacity just above the right horizontal fissure which may suggest progression of infection into right upper lobe. The right heart border was lost. During her admission at hospital, the opacity spread to right upper lobe and started to develop opacity on left lung field and more prominent air-bronchogram which consistent with wide spread of infection across both lung. Endotracheal tube can be seen at 2nd day of admission."
1,No thoracic abnormalities were noted.
1,"The patient has been receiving cough and dyspnoea for about 5 days and has therefore taken first therapy with amoxicillin / clavulanic acid per os and subsequently im ceftriaxione without benefit. He reports that he made a train journey from Florence to Rome (train from Venice) during which he had contacts with people from the red zone on 24 February. Patient with arterial hypertension in home therapy with Neolotan and Tiklid. On physical examination, it appears slightly tachypnoic at rest, asymptomatic for thoraco-abdominal pain, complains of dyspnea, MV diffusely reduced, basal crepitation on the left. Softened confluent densities with peripheral distribution with associated thickening of the interstitial weft. No pleural effusion."

0,Cough and loss of weight over five weeks.  Large cavitating right upper lobe mass with cavitation. Left lung is clear. Normal cardiomediastinal contour.
1,"Fever and non-productive cough start from 5 days ago. Patchy peripheral opacities are seen at the lung fields mid to lower zones.  Bilateral multi-lobar peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities are seen in both lungs, mostly mid to lower zones."
0,"After successful treatment, an almost complete regression of the the left lower lobe consolidation can be seen."
1,"Case 2: chest x-ray obtained on Jan 6 (2A). The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiple patchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadows were mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B)"
1,"Chest x-ray images and chest CT images from a 12-year-old boy showing that there was no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs, the structure of pulmonary hilus was clear, the trachea was unobstructed, mediastinum was not displaced, and no enlarged lymph node shadow was found."
0,"A confluent consolidation with air bronchograms has developed in the left lower zone, completely effacing the diaphragm on that side.  Findings are in line with left lower lobe aspiration pneumonia. The nasogastric tube remains in a satisfactory position."
1,COVID-19 pneumonia manifesting as single nodular lesion. Anteroposterior chest radiograph shows single nodular consolidation (arrows) in left lower lung zone.
0,Adult female with positive HIV infection and low CD4 count. Shortness of breath and cough. The visualized lung fields show hazy opacification with peribronchial and some interstitial prominence in the form of fine reticular interstitial pulmonary pattern. The case showed progressive deterioration as shown from the demonstrated XR sequences. The last one shows more diffuse infiltrates with ET tube insertion in ventilated victim. Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities or septal thickening are present. A crazy paving pattern may therefore be seen when both ground-glass opacies and septal thickening are superimposed on one another.
0,SARS in a 74-year-old man who developed symptoms 4 days after exposure.
1,Pulmonary picture improvement.
0,"SARS in a 29-year-old woman who presented 7 days after exposure. (a) Posteroanterior radiograph depicts a subtle focus of consolidation in the right lower zone, partly obscured by breast tissue. (b) Posteroanterior radiograph obtained 5 days later shows that the consolidation has expanded and become more dense. The chest radiograph obtained 13 days after admission was normal."
